## Dog Breed Identification

Submission for a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/) to recognize dog breeds in photos. This model used Transfer Learning from a pretrained InceptionV3 Network, training only the top layer. Accuracy of 79.9% and Top 5 Accuracy of 97.2% was achieved.

## Scrobbling Predictor

Music listening habits prediction as time series from my own data. A LSTM network was used.

## Song Encoder

This project explores the possibility of encoding songs as fixed length vectors. A custom AutoEncoder using negative sampling was trained using my own data and existing library solutions were also considered. 


## FashionMNIST

Basic example of using a Convolutional Neural Network for classification using the FashionMNIST dataset.
